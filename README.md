Data Science Project
This Data Science project serves the purpose to document my programming skills and my knowledge in 
quantitative analysis of data (including data cleaning, data visualization, data mining).

I have collected macroeconomic data for all german districts from the Federal Statistical Office and 
websites of other authorities, including the election results of the last Bundestag election. 
In the next step I have read and cleaned the data. Afterwards I created some descriptive statistics 
and in the last step I applied several advanced statistical machine learning algorithms to classify the 
best party in each constituency.

The code can be found in the jupyter notebook file called pythonDataScienceProject. Also, I uploaded all datasets I used.
